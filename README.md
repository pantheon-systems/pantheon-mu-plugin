The Pantheon Must-Use Plugin has been designed to tailor the WordPress CMS experience for Pantheon's platform.

What does that mean? We're glad you asked!

## WebOps Workflow
**Integrates WordPress with Pantheon Worklow.** Encourages updating plugins and themes in the Development environment and using Pantheon's git-based upstream core updates. Alerts admins if an update is available but disables automatic updates (so those updates can be applied via the upstream).

## Login
**Customized login form.** The login page links back to the Pantheon dashboard on dev, test and live environments that do not have a domain attached.

## Edge Cache (Global CDN)
**Facilitates communication between Pantheon's Edge Cache layer and WordPress.** It allows you to set the default cache age, clear individual pages on demand, and it will automatically clear relevant urls when the site is updated. Authored by [Matthew Boynes](http://www.alleyinteractive.com/).

## WordPress Multisite Support
**Simplified multisite configuration.** The `WP_ALLOW_MULTISITE` is automatically defined on WordPress Multisite-based upstreams. The Network Setup pages and notices have been customized for a Pantheon-specific WordPress multisite experience.

## Maintenance Mode
**Put your site into a maintenance mode.** Prevent users from accessing your sites during major updates by enabling Maintenance Mode either in the WordPress admin or via WP-CLI.

## Install With Composer
**Built for Composer.** While Pantheon automation ensures that the latest version of the MU plugin are pushed with every update to WordPress, the Composer-based project ensures that you can manage it alongside your other WordPress mu-plugins, plugins and themes in your `composer.json`.

```bash
composer require pantheon-systems/pantheon-mu-plugin
```
